### Limitations (TODO)
  * Planets don't rotate
  * Body positions are detached from their orbits a little

### Other TODO
  * "Spacecraft" or "Missions" info panel
  * Select date
  * "Warp to Here"
  * Peri/Apoapsis indicators
  * Body thumbnails in sidebar list
  * Hotkey to hide UI
  * BUG Shift + Scroll doesn't work on linux/chromium
  * Maybe include some info somewhere like orbital period, inclination, altitude, etc. (could be cool for probes)
  * Work on making the Sun cooler
  * Add Cassini grand finale
  * Don't focus if click is drag start
  * Scenarios -- planned camera positions, time warps, and descriptive text
    - url params so you can link to a specific time/body/camera view
    - a way to export these so you can form a link to time/body/camera view

  * Only way I can see to do shadows is to always use a close-ish spotlight instead of a pointlight located at the sun
    - illuminate local systems, not the whole solar system
  * Standardize usage of userData vs direct fields
  * BUG? dates seem a little off -- e.g. there should be a total eclipse June 21, but the moon is too far along in its orbit
